7.5 Breakeven Analysis
Fixed Costs (Monthly): $8,800
Variable Costs (COGS - 40% of Sales): For each month, the COGS is 40% of sales.
The breakeven point occurs when Revenue = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs.
Assuming fixed costs and sales:
Breakeven revenue = $8,800 / (1 - 0.40) = $14,666.67 per month
7.6 Ratio Analysis
Here are the industry comparison ratios, using a fictional comparison (you should fill in the actual industry data if available):
Ratio	Company	Industry	Variance	Explanation
Current Ratio	1.5	1.8	-0.3	A current ratio of 1.5 is a bit lower than the industry standard.
Days of Working Capital	45	40	5	Slightly higher due to longer cash cycle.
Quick Ratio	1.2	1.5	-0.3	Slightly below industry expectations.
Debt-to-Equity Ratio	0.5	0.4	0.1	Higher leverage ratio.
Return on Equity (ROE)	12%	15%	-3%	Slightly lower than industry average.

7.7 Risks & Assumptions
LOS A – The Risks and Assumptions in the Financial Projections
1.	Under-Capitalization
Risk: Short funding can limit a company from meeting its startup and operational costs thus facing cash flow challenges.
Mitigation: The initial funding should be used to finance at least half a year of the center’s costs of both necessities and variables. This could be made available in form of a buffer to ensure that any form of financial risk and/or risk related to employment that may rear its ugly head isn’t greatly felt due to lack of sufficient capital.
2.	Fluctuating Sales
Risk: Revenue might be inconsistent with high sales throughout a year or may drop at some point in the year, making an impact on the profit margin.
Mitigation: Ensure that strategic flexibility anchored on the firm’s operation, is incorporated so that the strategy change to reflect market demands on pricing. Introduced different products in order to keep on selling them.
3.	Poor Economic Conditions
Risk: A poor economy or recession can demoralize customers and reduce sales and hence lower the company’s revenue.
Mitigation: Concentrate upon the loyal customer base, improve the operational performance, and control avoidable costs. Keep track of changes that track the economistic level in order to determine market shifts.
4.	Competition
Risk: An entry of new competitor or new entrant or an existing competitor can lead to the threat of capturing the market share.
Mitigation: Competitive advantage, product/service differentiation, while delivering superior value to the customer.
5.	Cost Overruns
Risk: Fluctuations in costs that were not previously considered in the computations, for example Rising supply costs, increased labor costs, may lower profitability.
Mitigation: Control operating costs are tight, negotiate good deals with suppliers, and stay vigilant over budgetary issues.

8.0 Funding Request & Exit Strategy
8.1 Amount & Type of Funds Requested
•	Total Funding Requested: $138,000
•	Type of Funds Requested:
	Equity Investment: $50 000 from the owner’s own money.
o	Bank Loan: $70,000
o	Family/Friends Gift: $18,000
These payments are needed to get the business off the ground and to support the business in its first year of operation; this means payments for equipment, inventory, legal fees, and marketing.
Mitigation Plan: In order to minimize the risk of suffering from financial instability, the company will ensure that it has enough cash in its coffers at some point in the fiscal area of at least sixteen weeks of operation. Also, we will not commit ourselves to expensive general and administrative costs and keep ourselves free to change prices to accommodate the market environment. This approach will make sure that the company will be able to overcome problems that may come when operations will be running steadily.
To set the target of $15,000 per month, the estimated start-up cost $123,000 is first multiplied by a factor of $2.220, with the result being divided by the total monthly operating expenses needed to break even.
A. future proposals to float bonds
Bond Issuance: Of course, in the future, having the experience and achieving a condition of solvency, the company may decide to issue bonds for additional increase in capital basing on their development, for example, vast investments in creation of new facilities and technologies, as well as expansion in different markets. Bonds will be analyzed with regard to its market place and its capacity to repay its liabilities.
8.2 Exit Plan
A. Investor Pay-out/Repayment
Investor Exit Strategy: It provides a distribution to investors regarding the equity share upon targeted financial profitable achievement, such as a particular level of revenue accomplishment. In most cases once the debts are cleared, the profits will be shared amongst the investor on the basis of their equity holding in the business, after five to seven years from the formation of the business.
B. Franchising and/or Licensing Plans
Franchising: With time more outlets and brand awareness, franchise could be one of the options for exiting the business. Franchise selling will help a company grow a lot faster by not having to front the expense of setting up new outlets.
Licensing: However, license could be sought for some of the products or certain intellectual properties in order to get more sources of income without necessarily going out to look for the markets to sell the products.
